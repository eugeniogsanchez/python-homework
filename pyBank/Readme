## Unit 2 | Homework Assignment: Automate Your Day Job with Python

Background
You've made it! It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required PyBank Python activity, and if you wish to stretch your skills even further, the optional PyRamen Python activity. Both activities present a real-world situation in which your newfound Python skills will come in handy. These activities are far from easy, though, so expect some hard work ahead!

Before You Begin
Create a new GitHub repo called python-homework. Then, clone it to your computer.
In your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python activities. Use folder names that correspond to the activities: PyBank and PyRamen.
In each folder you just created, add a new file called main.ipynb. Remember that to create this file you will need to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. This will be the main notebook to run for each analysis.
Push the above changes to GitHub.

PyBank (Required)
In this activity, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:


'''python
import pandas as pd


#reading the data from a csv file
df = pd.read_csv("budget_data.csv")


#variables
total_months = 0
net_pnl = 0
avg_pnl = 0

greatest_dec_profits = 0

#getting statistics

greatest_inc_profits = df['Profit/Losses'].max()
greatest_dec_profits = df['Profit/Losses'].min()
avg_pnl = df['Profit/Losses'].mean()
